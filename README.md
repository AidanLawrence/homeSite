# homeSite
My home site along with all the files associated with it.

Everything should be placed in a folder called "Home".
All of the audio files should be placed in the "Home" folder in a seperate folder called "music".
All of the images with the ending ".gif" should be placed in the "Home" folder in a seperate folder called "img".
All other files just stay in the main "Home" folder.
